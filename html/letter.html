            <br><b>Subjects of Study</b><br><br>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility-
             as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology.
              You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd Saying that,
               of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:<br>

                         increases (effect of 3*10> 3*10) </li>

               </ol><br>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects,
                inc luding on how long you'd expect the rescarch to take. required staff and other resources,

                 Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctoral work I did stuly exotic tribal dances to answer your question
                 my favourite Dances are as follows, with <mark>Difinitions:</mark><br><br>
                 <ul>
                     <li>
                 <strong><i>Polynesian chicken dance</i></strong></li>
                 </ul> A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC,
                  the whole village would dance around in a chickens-like cirque, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".<br>
                  <ul>
                      <strong><i><li> Icelandic brownian shuffle</li></i></strong>
                  </ul>
                  Before lcelanders developed fire as a means of getting wam, they used to practice this dance,
                   which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor,
                    and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements.
                     One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modem styles such as Twerking.<br>
                     <ul>
                         <li>
                                <strong><i>Arctic robot dance</i></strong>
                         </li>
                     </ul>
